<h1 id="revit-extension-for-visual-studio">Revit Extension for Visual Studio</h1>
<p>This extension for Visual Studio provides a template for creating a Revit Addin for any Revit version with most boiler-plate code ready.
After creting a new project based on this template, compiling and debugging will immediatelly be possible. This should gives novices an easy and clean &quot;Hello World&quot; application that can scale as they learn.
Experienced Revit Addin creators can also be up and running with their ideas very quickly.</p>

<h3 id="features">Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>The solution generated by this template consists of one project for each Revit version from 2018 forward.</li>
<li>Each project references a single &quot;Resources&quot; project for files, images, and icons they have in common.</li>
<li>Each project references a single &quot;Shared&quot; project where all code they have in common resides. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/cross-platform/app-fundamentals/shared-projects?tabs=windows" title="See the documentation on Shared Projects.">See the documentation on Shared Projects.</a></li>
<li>The Compilation Symbol for each project is set to Revit2018, Revit2019, etc. </li>
<li>RevitAPI.dll, RevitAPIUI.dll, and AdWindows.dll are all included and referenced in the template using the latest version for each Revit year in the corresponding project.</li>
<li>Each project will have its own Revit manifest file (.addin), and that file is set to Copy Always to the output directory. A new GUID is automatically generated for the AddinId.</li>
<li>Post-build events are generated to copy any .dll and .addin files from the output directory of each project to the respective installed Revit addin folder.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="planned-improvements">Planned Improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Implement a form in the wizard to collect user preferences when creating a new project.</li>
<li>[ ] Get user input to create the manifest file (.addin) and edit the assembly (AssemblyInfo.cs) of each project.</li>
<li>[ ] Based on user input, create either a new &quot;Application&quot; addin or a &quot;Command&quot; addin.</li>
<li>[ ] Detect when a debugging session begins/ends and clear/restore the addins that Revit loads. The goal is to run addins that are in active development <em>only</em>  when debugging, and to reduce the chances of unrelated addins interacting with the addin being developed.</li>
<li>[ ] Better documentation.</li>
<li>[ ] More!!</li>
</ul>
