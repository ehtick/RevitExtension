# Revit Extension for Visual Studio
This extension for Visual Studio provides a template for creating a Revit Addin for any Revit version with most boiler-plate code ready.
After creting a new project based on this template, compiling and debugging will immediatelly be possible.



### Features/Roadmap

- The solution generated by this template consists of one project for each Revit version from 2018 forward.
- Each project references a single "Resources" project for files, images, and icons they have in common.
- Each project references a single "Shared" project where all code in common resides. [See the documentation on Shared Projects.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/cross-platform/app-fundamentals/shared-projects?tabs=windows "See the documentation on Shared Projects.")
- RevitAPI.dll, RevitAPIUI.dll, and AdWindows.dll are all included and referenced in the template using the latest version for each Revit year in the corresponding project.
